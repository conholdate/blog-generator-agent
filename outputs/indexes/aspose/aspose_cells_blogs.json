        "Detect Hyperlink TypeThere can be different types of hyperlinks which can be used in an Excel file like external, cell reference, file path and email. Our new release has introduced an enumerator **TargetModeType** which represents the type of hyperlink. A new property **LinkType** is introduced in Hyperlink class which return the hyperlink type using above mentioned enumerator. See the document on how to [detect different types of hyperlinks][4] for your complete reference. Here is an example which can be used to exercise this new feature. {{< gist aspose-com-gists 922f990b02cf4e04a328bd6f37029af8 \"Examples-CSharp-Workbook-DetectLinkTypes-1.cs\" >}}",
        "Get Total Page Count before PDF or Image RenderingWell, the title is explaining this new feature. When a file has too many pages, the process of converting to pdf/image may use too much memory and CPU, and OOM exception may be thrown. Getting total pages count before converting can indicate this risk, and do some actions (e.g. skip this file) or print the selected pages to avoid the undesired results. For example one of my sample Excel file (870 KB) was showing about 38 million pages. Just imagine, what will happen if you come across a conversion containing such a huge number of pages. Following is an example to show the usage of new classes **SheetPrintingPreview** and **WorkbookPrintingPreview**. Both of these classes contain a property **EvaluatedPageCount** which returns the page count of the printout or PDF file. {{< gist aspose-com-gists 922f990b02cf4e04a328bd6f37029af8 \"Examples-CSharp-Workbook-PrintPreview-1.cs\" >}} See the document on [printing preview workbook and worksheet][5] for your complete reference.",
        "Extracting Embedded MOL FileAs you know that molecular data file created in the MDL Molfile format, a chemical file format; contains plain text information and stores information about atoms and bonds; often used as a standard exchange format for molecular information. This type of file can be embedded in the Excel file. In this latest release, support is provided to extract object of such an uncommon type i.e. MOL. The following code snippet demonstrates extracting embedded MOL file and saving it to disk. {{< gist aspose-com-gists 922f990b02cf4e04a328bd6f37029af8 \"Examples-CSharp-Workbook-ExtractEmbeddedMolFile-1.cs\" >}} See the document [on extract embedded MOL file][6] for your reference.",

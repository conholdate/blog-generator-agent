## 3. Platform Gap Analysis

| Platform | # topics covered | % of baseline rows | # topics missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **net** | 12 | 100.0% | 0 |
| **cpp** | 0 | 0.0% | 12 |
| **general** | 1 | 8.3% | 11 |
| **java** | 2 | 16.7% | 10 |

**Takeaway:** Focus first on platforms with the highest missing counts and lowest coverage percentage; port high-impact topics from the best-covered platform first.

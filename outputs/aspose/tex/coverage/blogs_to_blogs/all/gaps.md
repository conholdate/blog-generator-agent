## 3. Platform Gap Analysis

| Platform | # topics covered | % of baseline rows | # topics missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **general** | 15 | 35.7% | 27 |
| **java** | 15 | 35.7% | 27 |
| **net** | 13 | 31.0% | 29 |
| **python** | 7 | 16.7% | 35 |

**Takeaway:** Focus first on platforms with the highest missing counts and lowest coverage percentage; port high-impact topics from the best-covered platform first.

## 5. Quick Wins (low-effort expansions)

No quick wins detected with the current heuristic. Quick wins are defined as topics present on the baseline but missing on many other platforms.

---

## 6. Cross-Linking Opportunities

No cross-link suggestions generated (insufficient quick wins).

---

### Bottom Line

Prioritize porting/adapting high-impact baseline topics to the most under-covered platforms. Use the cluster table to organize work into repeatable series and publish platform-specific guides with consistent cross-linking.

## 3. Platform Gap Analysis

| Platform | # topics covered | % of baseline rows | # topics missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **net** | 7 | 100.0% | 0 |
| **cpp** | 0 | 0.0% | 7 |
| **general** | 1 | 14.3% | 6 |
| **java** | 2 | 28.6% | 5 |
| **python** | 1 | 14.3% | 6 |

**Takeaway:** Focus first on platforms with the highest missing counts and lowest coverage percentage; port high-impact topics from the best-covered platform first.

## 5. Quick Wins (low-effort expansions)

| Quick-win topic | Missing platforms | Estimated effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create and Edit PowerPoint PPT in ASP.NET | cpp, general, java, python | 1–2 days per platform |
| Convert ODP to PPTX in C# using Aspose.Slides | cpp, general, java, python | 1–2 days per platform |
| PowerPoint Presentation Converter - Convert PPTX to EMF in C# | cpp, general, java, python | 1–2 days per platform |
| Add QR Code to PowerPoint Presentation using C# | cpp, general, java, python | 1–2 days per platform |
| ASP.NET PowerPoint Viewer - Display PowerPoint Presentations in ASP.NET | cpp, general, java, python | 1–2 days per platform |
| Add Digital Signature to PowerPoint in C# | cpp, general, python | 1 day per platform |

*Heuristic: topics missing across many platforms but already present on baseline are prime candidates for rapid porting/adaptation.*

### Bottom Line

Prioritize porting/adapting high-impact baseline topics to the most under-covered platforms. Use the cluster table to organize work into repeatable series and publish platform-specific guides with consistent cross-linking.

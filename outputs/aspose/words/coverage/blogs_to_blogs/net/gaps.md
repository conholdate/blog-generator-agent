## 3. Platform Gap Analysis

| Platform | # topics covered | % of baseline rows | # topics missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **net** | 29 | 100.0% | 0 |
| **cpp** | 0 | 0.0% | 29 |
| **general** | 1 | 3.4% | 28 |
| **java** | 1 | 3.4% | 28 |
| **python** | 1 | 3.4% | 28 |

**Takeaway:** Focus first on platforms with the highest missing counts and lowest coverage percentage; port high-impact topics from the best-covered platform first.

### Bottom Line

Prioritize porting/adapting high-impact baseline topics to the most under-covered platforms. Use the cluster table to organize work into repeatable series and publish platform-specific guides with consistent cross-linking.
